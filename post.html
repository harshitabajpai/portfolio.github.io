		<h3>Attendence Management System</h3>
		<p>This application is built for automating the processing of attendance.
		<br>
		The project is a system that takes attendanceusingbarcode scanning. Every valid person is provided with a unique barcode.The valid user just has to scan their respective barcode throughscanner and the system note down their attendance in an excel sheet. The bar code for each valid person will keep on changing on daily basis and the respective bar code can be provided to the valid users through any medium.

	    <p>we thought to develop automatic attendance system using bar code scanning. In which the bar code of the people of an organization will keep on changing each day so that their previous bar code cannot be misused.This application is built for automating the processing of attendance. It also enhances the speed of performing attendance task easily.It includes present members ‘s id which scanned their code in front of attendance scanner.

		<h3>Tic Tac Toe</h3>


		<p>
			It is Terminal based application.
			<br>
			 In the particular game two players, X and O try to fill the cells with their respective marks. The computer reacts on every player’s every move according to the algorithm which determines the best rewarding position on the board. 
			 <br>
			 There will be two players in a game. Two signs represent each player. The general signs used in the game are X and O. Finally, there will be a board with 9 boxes.

		<h3>Research Paper on 4G to 5G Technology</h3>

		<p>
			I've  published a technical paper in the International Journal of Research in Electronics and Computer Engineering (IJRECE).
			5G is the newest mobile network that's replacing 4G technology by providing a number of improvements in speed, coverage, and reliability.
			<br>
			5G uses different kinds of antennas, operates on different radio spectrum frequencies, connects many more devices to the internet, minimizes delays, and delivers ultrafast speeds.
			<br>
			These high frequencies are great for a number of reasons, one of the most important being that they support a huge capacity for fast data. Not only are they less cluttered with existing cellular data, and so can be used in the future for increasing bandwidth demands, they're also highly directional and can be used right next to other wireless signals without causing interference.

		<p>
			What all of this means is that 5G networks can broadcast ultrafast data to a lot more users, with high precision and little latency.
